        academic journey
      </h1>
      <p>
        My journey started with an Associate Degree in Mechatronics, where I
        learned to craft seamless interaction between hardware and software
        components. My final project was a 3D Engraving Machine using Visual
        Basic .NET.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then pursued a Bachelor`s Degree in Computer Science, where I delved
        into the micro frontend concept and created a user-friendly experience
        using React.JS to build a human resource app for a company`s task
        management.
      </p>
      <p>
        I`ve also completed various courses and certifications in Flutter, Dart,
        Strategic Management, Statistics, Probability, and English.
